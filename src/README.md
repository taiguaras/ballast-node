Comments about my solution

I started setting up the project files and git.
The first feature I added was auth and register.
Second thing I decided to do was the CRUD operations for the indications.
After that part was working the way I wanted, I decided to work on the file parsing endpoint.
This part was taking too long so I decided to move to other items.
Next item I worked was the Postgre database saving since so far all of this was saving in memory only.
Connected the database and made it work, I started to work on the drug CRUD and then came back to the file parsing and map icd10 relations.
Once I made it work I stared then progressing more on the tests, once I was satisfied with the outcome of the tests, 
I then started dockerizing the environment, which was the last feature I was able to work on fully.
I started working on connecting the icd10 relation with the enrichment from the OpenAi api but wasn't able to finish it nor committing a partial solution.

This was my line of thoughts when building this app and my overall experience coding it was great, even though I think there should be more context of all the app needs and real life usage of the solution in order to provide better insights.
